# Modelling Diffusion of trace elements in minerals

This is a repository for all things pertaining to the modelling of diffusive equilibration of trace elements in minerals. Currently there are models for:

- trace elements (e.g., Mg and Sr) in plagioclase. This is built off the methodology initally described by [Costa et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703702013455). ```plag_diffusion_model.ipynb``` and ```plag_diff.py``` are used in the following manuscripts:
    - [Jordan Lubbers, Adam J R Kent, Shanaka de Silva, Thermal Budgets of Magma Storage Constrained by Diffusion Chronometry: the Cerro Gal√°n Ignimbrite, Journal of Petrology, Volume 63, Issue 7, July 2022, https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egac048](https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article/63/7/egac048/6601565) 
- Isotropic diffusion modelling (i.e., Fick's 2<sup>nd</sup> Law). This uses the specific example of Sr diffusion in hornblende, however as there is no compositional dependence or crystallographic dependence on diffusion coefficient, the same logic can be used for any mineral - element pair that exhibits isotropic diffusion. 
- Basic 3D diffusion using numerically generated data that simulates Sr in sanidine. 

## Dependencies
All the code in here uses the "typical" scipy stack.

- pandas: importing geochemical data, manipulating dataframes
- numpy: the backbone of all numerical calculations
- matplotlib: visualization of data and model results
- tqdm: displaying inline progress bars while models run
- scipy: statistical calculations, interpolation functions

Optionally, for quicker data visualization, seaborn is also used. 


## Useful things

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tig0Ex6ZiVMGUX5Xusm2lfVL8LBtROBb/view?usp=sharing) is an example of how to code a fast and efficient diffusion equation that capitalizes on vectorized math operations from Numpy. It is about 70 times faster than using a scalar (i.e., double for-loop) approach. This is especially handy when your diffusion equation becomes more complicated. All the examples in this repository utilize this methodology.
